# GameJam-2022
Code and Report relating to the 72-hour University GameJam competition
## Theme
As our GameJam 2022 entry, we developed “State of mind”. A game designed
using unity game engine and scripted using the language C#.
Our theme for this year’s GameJam was Mental Health. In line with this, we
came up with the idea of creating a single player game – an elderly man. The
player who has Alzheimer’s disease must work through the different levels, to see
the different stages of Alzheimer’s.
The aim of our game is to collect as many memories as possible without the
character being hit by enemies, in order see how Alzheimer’s disease affects the
memories of someone.
In order for the character to move, the person playing the game must choose
his preference from either using the wasd keys, or the arrow keys along with the
shift key to dash.
State of mind is set in the mind of the elderly man. The mind is made to look
like a maze, in which the player has to navigate through to collect the memories
and avoid the enemies.
